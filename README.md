# EĞLENCELİ BİLİM, For Impacthub Innovation Hackathon 2021 

Science is everywhere and life with science is fun!
Working with children, for children and around children is one of the most fun, difficult, entertaining and most rewarding things in the world.


## Main Idea

We think that a science education will protect all children's well-being for today and for the future. 
When we say "science", we imagine a world full of children who feel excitement, who examine their surroundings with curiosity, and desire to discover the hidden world of science in life. 

In general, concepts of hands-on and minds-on science are not different things. Because at schools, teachers are the guiders for these programs, but for "Science at Home" we can only reach the children via our videos. So this inhibits students being minds-on and being their own discoverers from an early age.



## Our Aims

- Dive deeper into the importance of hands on learning - or simply active learning - for children.
- Allow children to explore by themselves what they are capable of on the website, without the guidance, assitance or even presence of someone around them.
- Allow children to play their part in the learning process - rather than just sitting and listening they engage and actively participate with the teacher (or in our case the website). 


## What eglencili bilim needed for their website
Eglencili bilim is a website that provides "science at home" for children. They wanted to make their website more active, attractive, and combine science lessons with fun games that will make children enjoy the learning process.


## How we met their requirements 
In our project, we chose to have a character that the children can relate to. This character welcomes the student to the level they are in - (the planet in our case) and guides them throughout the level. Once the children complete each level, they have the option to play a game - as a reward. This reward allows the children to feel a sense of accomplishment for what they have achieved and look forward to the coming levels (planets) and the rewards that they can get it in each level.
